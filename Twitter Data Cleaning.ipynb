    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lots of data duplicates inside the data file. If we look into the raw data, those tweet duplicates was tweeted from different places, which means those tweets are tweeted by different accounts and (probably) different users. For some cases, if the analysis fancy the location detail, those duplicated tweet may should not be deleted, but if the analysis only requires the tweets and doesn't care about the location or any other data attributes, then the duplicated tweets may should be deleted. And in this case, I consider to delete the duplicated tweets anyway cause in this program, we assume that we only need the tweets for nlp analysis purpose or something like that."
